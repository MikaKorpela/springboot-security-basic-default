# springboot-security-default #

The ```spring-boot-starter-security``` dependency enables the authentication and authorization in all end-points.

The default security configuration creates one user with username ```user``` and a random password. The password is printed in the console when the application starts.

The default security configuration does not include any settings for authorization.
